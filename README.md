# MedicTrack

MedicTrack is a Hospital Management System built in C++ that uses the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. This project is designed to assist healthcare facilities in managing key operations such as patient records, doctor scheduling, and staff management. By reducing manual paperwork and centralizing information, the system improves the efficiency of the Hospital where it's used.

## Why this project? 
Hospitals and clinics face the challenge of organizing vast amounts of information while maintaining reliability, confidentiality, and efficiency. This project is interesting because it simulates a real world application of software in healthcare and demonstrates how object oriented design can complete this kind of tasks. By implementing concepts such as classes and inheritance, this system offers a hands on opportunity to apply OOP in a meaningful and socially relevant context.
