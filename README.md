# TC1030.302-MedixTrack

MedixTrack is a Hospital Management System built in C++ that uses the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. This project is designed to assist healthcare facilities in managing key operations such as patient records, doctor scheduling, and staff management. By reducing manual paperwork and centralizing information, the system improves the efficiency.

The system focuses on managing essential components in a hospital environment, including:

Registration and tracking of patients and medical staff

Scheduling and logging of doctor appointments

Storing patient history, medication data, and examination results

Simplified billing records and service logs

All records will be managed using file handling techniques in C++, providing a lightweight alternative to full-scale database solutions.
